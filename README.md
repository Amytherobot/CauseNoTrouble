Howdy!!!

This is a little papers-please clone I started after my intro to python class. I saw Thats Not My Neighbor and I got inspired to do something similar.
I will probably continue to work on this game BUT FOR NOW:

1. There's no story or arcade mode, you play until the work day is over, as in, when you've gone through about 10 people or you die.
2. I am DEFINITELY planning on adding an arcade mode, alongside a timer mechanic and some other things that I'll likely think of as I sift through the code.
3. This SHOULD work by clicking the exe file itself, if it doesn't its because Python needs to be installed on your computer first.
4. If you have IDLE on your computer, I coded a version that works in IDLE! I likely won't be updating that version but it is there.

If all goes well, the exe file should open up a lil black window and start showing you some text asking about a tutorial.
I hope you enjoy!!!
