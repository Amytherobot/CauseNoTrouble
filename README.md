Howdy!!!

This is a little papers-please clone I started after my intro to python class. I saw Thats Not My Neighbor and I got inspired to do something similar.
I will probably continue to work on this game BUT FOR NOW:

1. There's no story or arcade mode, you play until the work day is over, as in, when you've gone through about 10 people or you die.
2. I am DEFINITELY planning on adding an arcade mode, alongside a timer mechanic and some other things that I'll likely think of as I sift through the code.
3.
